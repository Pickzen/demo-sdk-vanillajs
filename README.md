Demo project that shows how we can use the Pickzen SDK to create a Vanilla JavaScript application that recommends products.

## Usage

In the project directory, execute:

#### `yarn install`

#### `yarn start`

## Configuration

By default it will load a demo Assistant. To use your own Assistant, set its code in the `index.js` file:

```
const quizCode = 'HPTkH7GAWjx';
```
